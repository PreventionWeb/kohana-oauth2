# Kohana OAuth2 Module Readme

Forked from Qbqllinternet to have the 3.3 support. Originaly forked from https://github.com/managedit/kohana-oauth2.

This version tries to go further finalize some remaining unfinished work.

# Updates:
- Models are extending ORM to use standard Kohana processing of data from database tables

# TODO
- Handle token expiration by storing the token starting date and the end date with the difference with the expiration time
